# Data Analysis Portolio Projects

## Project 1 (SQL)

For the purpose of the above project, I downloaded a Covid-19 dataset from the below website:

<a href = "https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths"> Our World in Data </a>

After downloading SQL Server and SQL Management Studio into the system, I extracted data from the Covid 19 dataset as a table in SQL Management Studio and then used it to gather the insights using the queries given in the below SQL file:

<a href = "Project 1/Covid19.sql"> Covid19.sql </a>

## Project 2 (Tableau)

From the table that I had created in SQL Management Studio in Project 1, I created 4 excel sheets, each containing the below data:

1. World Death Percentage Among New Covid Cases
2. Continent Wise Death Count
3. Country wise Covid Case Percentage
4. Country & Date wise Covid Case Percentage

Using the above, I created a Tableau Dashboard, which can be found in the link below:

## Project 3 (SQL Data Cleaning)

For the purpose of this project, I downloaded a Nashville Housing dataset from the below github repository:

<a href = "https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects"> Nashville Housing Dataset </a>

Just like in Project 1, imported the data into Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. I then cleaned the data using the queries in the below SQL file:

<a href = "Project 3/Nashville Housing.sql"> Nashville Housing.sql </a>

## Project 4 (Python)

For the purpose of this project, I downloaded a Movies dataset from Kaggle from the below link:

<a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies"> Movies dataset </a>

and after downloading Anaconda Navigator and launching Jupyter Notebooks, I cleaned and analyzed the data using Python. The code is available in the below file:

<a href = "Project 4/Movies.ipynb"> Movies.ipynb </a>
